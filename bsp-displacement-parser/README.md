Before using:
1. Make a copy of the original map file and place it somewhere else
2. Go to the ./bin/ of the game
3. Run the following command to unpack the map
```
./bspzip.exe -game ../tf -repack C:/some/path/mapname.bsp
```

Don't touch the original map, otherwise you won't be able to play on it due to checksum difference.
